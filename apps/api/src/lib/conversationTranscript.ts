/**
 * Joins a conversation's messages (oldest first) into one transcript so
 * Steps 1-3's existing deterministic engines can resolve a field mentioned
 * in an earlier turn even when the latest message alone doesn't repeat it —
 * e.g. "I want a Lamborghini Urus" in turn 1 plus "15 to 19 Oct" in turn 2
 * still resolves both the vehicle and the dates. Bounded to the most recent
 * messages/characters; for a single-message conversation this returns that
 * message's content unchanged.
 *
 * Each message's own content has any newline collapsed to a space *before*
 * joining, so "\n" in the result always means exactly one thing: a boundary
 * between two different messages, never a line break the customer typed
 * inside a single one. Consumers (e.g. VehicleIntentService.propose, which
 * scans this transcript one line at a time to prefer a later message's
 * correction over an earlier one) rely on that invariant — without it, a
 * customer's own multi-line message ("I want a Lamborghini Urus\nfor an SUV
 * trip please") would be misread as two separate turns, and the second
 * "turn" could wrongly outrank the first.
 *
 * A guess is not a choice: a clause like "I think Range Rover" or "maybe pick up in Dubai" is left out
 * of the transcript, so no later step can read it back as the car, the place or the date the customer
 * selected. The customer is asked to choose clearly instead (see frontDoor/clarification.ts).
