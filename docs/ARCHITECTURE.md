# Architecture — as built

This documents what actually exists in the repository today. `docs/MASTER-PLAN.md` is the
long-term target across all 10 phases; this file is updated at the end of every phase to reflect
reality. See `docs/PHASE-CONTRACTS.json` for per-phase status.

```

## Phase 2 scope: Extract Dates & Location (journey Step 2)

Input is a Phase 1 conversation's latest message (already validated + intent-recognized) —
this step never accepts raw text directly from a request body.

```
POST /v1/enquiries/:conversationId/dates-location
                │
                ▼
  findLatestMessageForConversation (tenant-scoped)
                │
                ▼
  DateLocationExtractionOrchestrator.extract(message.content)
                │
                ├─ sanitizeForProcessing()            — prompt-injection screen (reused from Phase 1)
                │
                ├─ LocationExtractionService.extract() ── ResilientLocationProvider ── GazetteerLocationProvider
                │      (AI proposes: pickup/dropoff candidates, by reading order)      (Dubai/UAE, zero network)
                │
                ├─ DateExtractionService.extract()
                │      (AI proposes: pickup/return dates — never guesses an ambiguous one)
                │
                └─ TemporalValidationService.validate()
                       (deterministic verifier: past-date / return-before-pickup /
                        impossible-date / timezone-mismatch / unsupported-location checks,
                        confidence scoring, always Zod-validated before it leaves here)
                │
                ▼
  one Prisma transaction: create DateLocationExtraction + write AuditEvent
                │
                ▼
  201 { conversationId, messageId, extraction }
```

**AI proposes, deterministic domain logic verifies** — the same split Phase 1 established for
intent recognition, made explicit here as three separate classes: `DateExtractionService` and
`LocationExtractionService` are the proposal layer (regex/gazetteer based, same zero-hallucination
design as Phase 1's engine); `TemporalValidationService` is the sole authority on whether the
proposal is usable, and its output is what gets persisted and returned — never the raw proposal.

## Phase 3 scope: Determine Vehicle (journey Step 3)

Same input convention as Step 2 — a conversation's latest message, never raw request-body text.

```
POST /v1/enquiries/:conversationId/vehicle-selection
                │
                ▼
  findLatestMessageForConversation (tenant-scoped)
                │
                ▼
  VehicleDeterminationOrchestrator.determine(message.content, { tenantId })
                │
                ├─ sanitizeForProcessing()          — prompt-injection screen (reused from Phase 1)
                │
                ├─ VehicleCatalogService.getLexicon(tenantId) ── PrismaVehicleCatalogProvider
                │      (real fleet, tenant-scoped — never a hardcoded make/model list)
                │
                ├─ VehicleIntentService.propose(text, lexicon)
                │      (AI proposes: exact model > brand only > category only > fuzzy typo,
                │       pure/zero-I/O — only ever proposes ids present in the real lexicon)
                │
                ├─ VehicleCatalogService.resolve(tenantId, proposal)
                │      (fetches full records for the proposal's candidates + real, bookable
                │       alternatives — widening to the general fleet if a category-scoped
                │       alternative search comes up empty)
                │
                └─ VehicleValidationService.validate()
                       (deterministic verifier: resolves / needs clarification / unsupported —
                        UNKNOWN_VEHICLE, VEHICLE_INACTIVE, VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE — confidence
                        scoring, always Zod-validated before it leaves here)
                │
                ▼
  one Prisma transaction: create VehicleDetermination + write AuditEvent
                │
                ▼
  201 { conversationId, messageId, determination }
```

**Database is authoritative; AI proposes, deterministic domain logic verifies** — the same split,
now with an explicit third component: `VehicleCatalogService` is the only class that touches the
real fleet, so "never invent inventory" is enforced structurally rather than by convention.

## Phase 4 scope: Ask Missing Information (journey Step 4)

No new "AI proposes" step this phase — everything here reads what Steps 1-3 already resolved.

```
POST /v1/enquiries/:conversationId/missing-info
                │
                ▼
  findConversationById + findLatestMessageForConversation (tenant-scoped)
                │
                ▼
  fetch the message's latest IntentRecord / DateLocationExtraction /
  VehicleDetermination in parallel (any or all may not exist yet)
                │
                ▼
  MissingInfoOrchestrator.evaluate({ intent, dateLocation, vehicle,
                                      conversationCreatedAt, now })
                │
                ├─ RequiredFieldsEvaluator.evaluate()
                │      (deterministic, zero I/O: PICKUP_DATE / RETURN_DATE / PICKUP_LOCATION /
                │       VEHICLE each present, or missing with reason NOT_PROVIDED / AMBIGUOUS /
                │       INVALID; NOT_APPLICABLE for a non-booking intent; EXPIRED past 24h)
                │
                └─ buildClarificationPrompt()
                       (deterministic template, one combined question — only when NEEDS_INFO)
                │
                ▼
  one Prisma transaction: create MissingInfoCheck + write AuditEvent
                │
                ▼
  201 { conversationId, messageId, missingInfo }
```

**Reads verified state, never re-parses raw text** — Steps 1-3 already did the work of turning
customer text into trusted, deterministically-verified fields; Step 4's only job is to look at what
exists (or doesn't) across all three and decide what's still needed, so it cannot itself introduce a
hallucinated value.

## Phase 5 (in progress) scope: WhatsApp Channel + Automated Step 1-4 Pipeline

The first slice of the original "Channels, Documents, Payments, CRM & Fulfilment" phase
(`PHASE-CONTRACTS.json` id 5): a real WhatsApp (Meta Cloud API) inbound/outbound adapter, plus a
fixed-sequence pipeline that runs Steps 1-4 automatically for one inbound message instead of
requiring each REST endpoint to be called by hand. Documents, payments, CRM, delivery/return and a
real persisted journey state machine (the Event/Workflow Engine) remain **not built** — see
`docs/PHASE-5-CHANNELS.md` for the full scope split.

```

**Channel-agnostic pipeline, channel-specific adapter.** `runFullEnquiryPipeline`
(`apps/api/src/services/enquiryPipelineService.ts`) takes a `channel` + `customerRef` + `message`
and knows nothing about WhatsApp; the WhatsApp-specific pieces (signature verification, Meta's
webhook envelope shape, the Graph API send call) live entirely in `packages/channels`. A future Web
chat or Email adapter reuses the same pipeline function.

**Claim-before-work idempotency, not check-then-act.** Steps 1-4 plus an outbound HTTP call can
take seconds, and Meta redelivers a webhook that hasn't answered fast enough. A `find` followed by
a `save` at the end leaves a wide window for two concurrent deliveries to both run the pipeline and
both send a reply. `claimIdempotencyKey` (`packages/db`) makes the claim itself the concurrency
gate — a single unique-constraint insert two racing requests can't both win — proven with a
genuinely concurrent (`Promise.all`) redelivery test, not just a sequential one.

## Eligibility scope (journey Step 5 — `ELIGIBILITY_CHECK`)

`PHASE-CONTRACTS.json` id 11 — the journey-step-numbered continuation of Phases 1-4, not id 5's
"Channels, Documents, Payments, CRM & Fulfilment" scope (see `docs/PHASE-5-CHANNELS.md`). Unlike
every earlier step, there is **no AI proposal stage at all**: MASTER-PLAN.md marks this step's owner
"SYS", and CLAUDE.md is explicit that "AI may explain rules but MUST NOT decide policy
independently" / "Never allow AI to override policy" — so nothing in this step ever calls an
`AIProvider`.

```

                │
                ▼
  201 { conversationId, messageId, decision }
```

**Policy and exceptions are data, not code.** `EligibilityPolicy` (versioned, append-only —
`createEligibilityPolicyVersion` inserts a new row and deactivates every previous one rather than
editing in place) and `EligibilityException` (VIP / nationality override / age override / manual
grant, each carrying its own `riskLevel`) are ordinary tenant-scoped DB rows, re-validated via Zod on
every read (`toDomainEligibilityPolicy`/`toDomainEligibilityException`) and validated before every
write (`eligibilityPolicyRulesSchema.parse`, `createEligibilityExceptionInputSchema.parse`) — the
same "never trust it just because it's our own DB" posture `toDomainVehicle` established. "Deterministic
and configurable" means every rule's _parameters_ live here; the rule _logic_ is fixed code in
`packages/ai/src/step5` that nothing (AI included) can override at decision time. No admin endpoint
manages these yet (Phase 7 Admin Dashboard scope) — today only `packages/db/src/seed.ts` and direct
repository calls create them, which is enough to prove the engine is genuinely policy-driven rather
than hardcoded.

**Every decision is auditable.** `EligibilityDecision` is an append-only row (the same convention as
`IntentRecord`/`DateLocationExtraction`/`VehicleDetermination`/`MissingInfoCheck`) carrying the exact
`policyId`/`policyVersion` evaluated, every rule's individual outcome, and which exceptions applied —
so a past decision can always be explained from its own stored row, never recomputed or guessed.

## Phase 12 scope: Availability (journey Step 6)

Real inventory availability — MASTER-PLAN.md journey Step 6 (`AVAILABILITY_CHECK`), the schema's
own forward reference from Phase 3 ("Real per-date availability/holds are journey Step 6, a
distinct later phase"). Not part of `PHASE-CONTRACTS.json`'s id-6 entry ("Security Engine & Zero
Trust", the original pre-journey-numbering grouping — see `docs/PHASE-CONTRACTS.json`'s
`phaseNumbering` note) — see `docs/PHASE-12.md` §1 for the numbering reconciliation. Input is a
conversation's already-resolved Step 3 vehicle + Step 2 dates, same convention as Steps 2-4.

```

**Never tell a customer a vehicle is available unless the authoritative source confirms it.**
`AvailabilityProvider.checkAvailability` (a non-locked, non-committal read sharing the same
`evaluateInventoryStatus` computation) exists as the seam a future multi-vehicle preview will use
(Step 7, Alternatives) — but the one HTTP endpoint in this phase always calls
`ReservationLockService.placeHold`, the only operation that may answer a customer, since only it
re-derives status _inside_ the per-vehicle lock.

**Capacity-based, not unit-assigned** — like hotel room-type inventory. `VehicleUnit` rows (real,
countable physical inventory per tenant+vehicle) give `DatabaseFleetProvider` a real count; a hold
blocks one unit of that count for a date range, never a specific physical car.

**Pessimistic locking guards the scarce resource; optimistic locking guards a single row.**
`placeHold` serializes concurrent attempts at the _same vehicle_ via a Postgres advisory lock —
correctness under real concurrency (proven by this phase's concurrent-booking/race-condition
tests), not merely "usually fine". `releaseHold`/`confirmHold` instead use `AvailabilityHold.version`
(optimistic): a losing racer against an already-transitioned hold sees 0 rows affected and a
`CONFLICT`, never a silent no-op — including a hold whose TTL has already lapsed but hasn't yet
been swept (`confirmHold` checks `expiresAt` explicitly, not just `status`, closing the same
lazy-expiration gap `countOverlappingHolds` already closes for capacity counting).

**`FleetProvider`** is a real seam, not a fake one: `DatabaseFleetProvider` (default, real,
DB-backed — "database remains source of truth") needs zero configuration; `ExternalFleetApiProvider`
(a real HTTP adapter, wrapped in `ResilientFleetProvider` for timeout/circuit-breaker/rate-limit and
`CachedFleetProvider` for a short Redis TTL) is available for a tenant with a real third-party fleet
system, reporting `NOT_CONFIGURED` rather than a fake integration when selected without credentials
— no such system exists to integrate with here, same posture as the WhatsApp/Payment providers.

## Phase 6 scope: Security Engine & Zero Trust

No request-flow diagram in the Steps 1-4 style — Phase 6 is a cross-cutting layer, not a journey
step. Full detail (STRIDE, the zero-trust layer mapping, RBAC matrix, key rotation runbook,
deliberate scope decisions) lives in `docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md`; `docs/PHASE-6.md` has what was built
and why. Summary:

```
POST /v1/auth/login {email, password, mfaCode?}
                │
                ▼
  find User by (tenantId, email) — tenantId is always DEFAULT_TENANT_ID today,
  same convention as every /v1 route; no tenant-selection step exists yet
                │
                ├─ wrong password / MFA code → recordLoginFailure + SecurityEvent,
                │    lock the account after 5 failures, flag tenant-wide velocity after 20
                │
                ▼ (success)
  issueRefreshToken() (new rotation family) + signAccessToken() (<=15 min JWT)
                │
                ▼
  201 { accessToken, refreshToken, user }

Authenticated request:  Authorization: Bearer <accessToken>
                │
                ▼
  verifyAccessToken() ── check Redis session-family revocation set ──▶ request.auth
                │
                ▼
  requirePermission(permission) preHandler ── authorize(auth, permission, {tenantId})
       (ABAC tenant-match, unconditional, before RBAC permission-matrix check)
                │
                ▼
  route handler, every DB call inside withTenantContext(prisma, auth.tenantId, …)
       (sets app.tenant_id for the transaction — Postgres RLS enforces it as the backstop)
```

Refresh-token rotation: every use both issues a new token AND revokes the old one
(`revokeRefreshTokenIfActive`, conditional on `revokedAt IS NULL` — race-safe under genuine
concurrency, not just sequential reuse). Presenting an already-revoked token — whether because it was
genuinely reused, or because a concurrent request won the same race — kills the entire rotation
family: every refresh token for that session is revoked in Postgres, and live access tokens are
denied immediately via the Redis revocation set rather than waiting out their own `exp`.

## Phase 16 scope: automatic Steps 5-8 chain + conversation engine v2

One inbound customer message, on any channel, now runs `handleInboundTurn`
(`apps/api/src/services/conversationTurnService.ts`):

```
Steps 1-4 (runFullEnquiryPipeline) -> syncJourneyAfterMissingInfo + CRM
   -> advanceJourneyAutomatically (journeyAutopilotService)
        ELIGIBILITY_CHECK      collect driver details (EligibilityIntake) -> Step 5
        AVAILABILITY_CHECK     Step 6 hold -> Step 8 quote  |  Step 7 alternatives
        OFFERING_ALTERNATIVES  same car: re-offer  |  other car: Step 6 -> 8
        QUOTE_ISSUED           accept -> human hand-off  |  question -> grounded answer
        any state              asks for a person / complaint / failure -> EscalationCase
   -> generateJourneyReply: deterministic draft -> Gemini rewrite -> grounding guard -> send
   -> recordOutboundReply (only after a real delivery)
```

Each hop calls the same step service and `record*Outcome` the REST endpoints use. The model
never decides a fact: it only rewords a draft built from verified step results, and any reply that
alters a number or makes an unearned claim is replaced by the draft. See `docs/PHASE-16.md`.

## Phase 17 scope: frontend completion (admin dashboard, human worker, customer web chat)

Staff pages under `/dashboard` and the customer PWA under `/concierge` are Next.js server/client
components that reach the API **only** through `backendFetch` (SSRF-safe, host allowlist) or the
route handlers in `apps/web/src/app/api/chat/*`; the browser never talks to the API directly.

- Staff read model: `/v1/dashboard/summary`, `/v1/quotes`, `/v1/conversations/:id/transcript`
  (`dashboardRepository` in `packages/db`). Human replies: `POST /v1/conversations/:id/reply`
  (`conversation:reply`, audit event without message text; WEB replies are stored and show up in
  the customer's chat, WHATSAPP/EMAIL go through the provider and are recorded only when delivered).
- Customer web chat: `POST /v1/chat/messages` runs the same `handleInboundTurn` as the other
  channels (customerRef `web:<sessionId>`), idempotent per `clientMessageId`, limited per session
  and globally in Redis. `GET /v1/chat/sessions/:id` returns messages, journey state and the issued
  quote (no integrity hash).
- Offline shell: service worker scoped to `/concierge`, never caches `/api/*`. See `docs/PHASE-17.md`.

  config/         shared env schema + fail-fast loader
  testing/        shared test fixtures + real-Postgres/Redis test helpers (no mocks)
```

Every package that produces types other packages consume (`domain`, `config`, `security`,
`observability`, `ai`, `contracts`, `db`, `testing`) builds via plain `tsc` to `dist/`, resolved by
consumers through the normal `package.json` `main`/`types` fields — **not** TypeScript project
references. `pnpm -r` already runs scripts in dependency order, so a library's `typecheck` script
doubles as its `build` (both just run `tsc`); apps (`api`, `worker`, `web`), which nothing else
imports, use `tsc --noEmit` for typecheck since they don't need to emit for anyone.

## Data model

`Tenant`, `Conversation`, `Message`, `IntentRecord`, `AuditEvent`, `IdempotencyKey` (Phase 1),
`DateLocationExtraction` (Phase 2), `Vehicle` and `VehicleDetermination` (Phase 3),
`MissingInfoCheck` (Phase 4), `User`/`RefreshToken`/`SecurityEvent` (Phase 6),
`EligibilityPolicy`/`EligibilityException`/`EligibilityDecision` (Step 5),
`VehicleUnit`/`AvailabilityHold`/`AvailabilityCheck` (Step 6) — see
`packages/db/prisma/schema.prisma`. Every business table carries `tenantId`; every repository
function takes `tenantId` explicitly and filters by it (`findFirst`/`updateMany` with `tenantId` in
the WHERE clause) — the **application-level** half of tenant isolation, unchanged since Phase 1.
**Database-level Row Level Security is implemented as of Phase 6** — `ENABLE`+`FORCE ROW LEVEL
SECURITY` plus a `tenant_isolation` policy on every table above except `refresh_tokens` and
`idempotency_keys` (looked up by an opaque secret alone, before any tenant is known — see
`docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md` §3 for why those two get a different policy shape), keyed on the
`app.tenant_id` session setting `withTenantContext()` sets per-transaction. Proven against real
Postgres, connected as the real least-privilege `ai_concierge_api`/`ai_concierge_worker` roles the
same migration creates — see `packages/db/src/repositories/rowLevelSecurity.security.test.ts`. Those
roles are not yet what the API/worker's own default `DATABASE_URL` connects as in local dev, CI, or
production as currently documented (`docs/SECURITY-MODEL.md` §3 — a Phase 10 cutover). `Vehicle`
additionally supports soft deletion (`deletedAt`) — every repository query excludes soft-deleted
rows, and nothing in the codebase issues a hard `DELETE` on that table. `EligibilityPolicy` is
similarly append-only-by-convention: a new version is inserted and every previous one deactivated,
never an in-place update.

## AI Intent Engine

`RuleBasedIntentEngine` (`packages/ai`) is **deterministic** — regex/keyword based, zero network
calls, zero hallucination risk. It classifies one of the 10 `IntentType` values, extracts entities
(vehicle, dates, location, passenger count, driver requirement, language, urgency) only when real
evidence is present in the message, and returns `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` whenever confidence is below
threshold or a `BOOKING_REQUEST` is missing a required field. Output is always validated against
`intentResultSchema` (Zod) before it leaves the engine. A real LLM provider is Phase 4 scope; the
`AIProvider`/`NotConfiguredProvider` seam already exists in `packages/ai/provider.ts` so that phase
implements an adapter rather than inventing the boundary under deadline pressure.

## Step 2 — Date & Location Extraction

- **`DateExtractionService`** — deterministic regex-based date proposal. Named-month dates, day
  ranges, ISO dates, numeric dates, `tomorrow`/`today`, `next <weekday>`. A numeric date whose
  day/month could be read either way (e.g. `10/11/26`) is reported as an `AMBIGUOUS_NUMERIC_DATE`
  ambiguity, never guessed; an impossible calendar date (`31 February`, `32/13/2026`) is verified
  via round-tripping through `Date.UTC` (`packages/ai/step2/calendar.ts`) and reported, never
  silently rounded. All resolved dates go through `zonedTimeToUtc` (`packages/ai/step2/timezone.ts`)
  — a DST-aware local-time→UTC conversion built on `Intl.DateTimeFormat`, no extra dependency.
- **`LocationExtractionService`** — resolves pickup/dropoff against an injected `LocationProvider`
  (`GazetteerLocationProvider` for Phase 2: a static Dubai/UAE gazetteer, zero network calls). Two
  distinct "couldn't resolve" signals: `UNRECOGNIZED_LOCATION_TEXT` (doesn't look like a known
  place) vs. `UNSUPPORTED_LOCATION` (a real, known city — e.g. London — just outside the current
  service area), the latter forward-compatible with "future cities/countries" once the gazetteer or
  a real geocoding provider grows.
- **`TemporalValidationService`** — the deterministic verifier. Checks: `PAST_DATE`,
  `RETURN_BEFORE_OR_EQUAL_PICKUP`, `IMPOSSIBLE_DATE`, `UNSUPPORTED_LOCATION`, `TIMEZONE_MISMATCH`
  (an explicit timezone mention in the message — e.g. "3pm EST" — conflicting with the resolved
  location's actual UTC offset at that instant). Computes a 0–1 confidence score and is the only
  place a `DateLocationExtractionResult` is constructed and Zod-validated.
- **`DateLocationExtractionOrchestrator`** — wires the three together: sanitize → locate → date →
  validate, defaulting to `Asia/Dubai` when no location resolved (Phase 2's single-market default,
  see `docs/phases/PHASE-2.md`).

## Step 3 — Determine Vehicle

- **`VehicleIntentService`** — pure, zero-I/O proposal step. Tiered, mutually-exclusive matching
  against a DB-sourced lexicon: exact model → brand only (unambiguous if the brand has one model) →
  category only (unambiguous if the category has one model) → typo-tolerant fuzzy match (a small,
  self-written Levenshtein implementation, `packages/ai/step3/levenshtein.ts`, no new dependency).
  Never proposes an id absent from the lexicon it was given; when nothing matches, reports either a
  vehicle-shaped phrase it couldn't resolve (for `UNKNOWN_VEHICLE`) or nothing at all (for
  `NO_VEHICLE_MENTIONED`) — a lone capitalized sentence-initial word ("What", "I") is deliberately
  never mistaken for either.
- **`VehicleCatalogService`** — the only class that talks to the real fleet, via an injected
  `VehicleCatalogProvider` (`PrismaVehicleCatalogProvider` in `apps/api`, tenant-scoped on every
  call — unlike Step 2's tenant-agnostic static gazetteer). Supplies the lexicon, the full records
  for whatever `VehicleIntentService` proposed, and a small set of genuinely bookable alternatives —
  widening from a category-scoped search to the general active fleet if the narrower one comes up
  empty, so a customer is never left with nothing to choose from.
- **`VehicleValidationService`** — the deterministic verifier. Decides `RESOLVED` (single, active,
  `AVAILABLE` match) vs. `NEEDS_CLARIFICATION` (multiple candidates, or nothing mentioned) vs.
  `UNSUPPORTED` (`UNKNOWN_VEHICLE`, `VEHICLE_INACTIVE`, or `VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE`). Computes a 0–1
  confidence score and is the only place a `VehicleDeterminationResult` is constructed and
  Zod-validated.
- **`VehicleDeterminationOrchestrator`** — wires the three together: sanitize → lexicon → propose →
  resolve → validate. Requires a real `VehicleCatalogProvider` (no zero-config default exists, unlike
  Step 2's Dubai/UAE gazetteer, since there's no sensible generic fleet to fall back to).
- **Three distinct "not available" states**, deliberately kept separate: `deletedAt` (soft-deleted —
  behaves as if the vehicle never existed), `active` (a real entry, disabled by the business —
  `VEHICLE_INACTIVE`), `availabilityStatus` (a real, active entry temporarily down —
  `VEHICLE_UNAVAILABLE`, a catalog-level flag only, not a date-range booking calendar; that's journey
  Step 6, a distinct later phase).

## Step 4 — Ask Missing Information

- **`RequiredFieldsEvaluator`** — pure, zero-I/O. Checks four required fields (`PICKUP_DATE`,
  `RETURN_DATE`, `PICKUP_LOCATION`, `VEHICLE` — matching Phase 1's own `BOOKING_REQUIRED_FIELDS`,
  now backed by Steps 2-3's real verified values instead of Phase 1's keyword-evidence check)
  against narrow `IntentSnapshot`/`DateLocationSnapshot`/`VehicleSnapshot` inputs. A missing field
  carries one of three reasons: `NOT_PROVIDED` (the step never ran, or found nothing),
  `AMBIGUOUS` (the step flagged an ambiguity), `INVALID` (the step rejected a resolved value, e.g.
  `PAST_DATE` or `VEHICLE_INACTIVE`). A non-`BOOKING_REQUEST` intent short-circuits to
  `NOT_APPLICABLE`; an incomplete conversation past the 24h window is `EXPIRED` instead of
  `NEEDS_INFO`. `dropoffLocation` is read into `collected` for transparency but is never required.
- **`buildClarificationPrompt`** — deterministic, template-based (no LLM call): one combined,
  Oxford-comma-joined question covering every current gap, so a single customer reply can address
  all of them rather than being asked one question at a time.
- **`MissingInfoOrchestrator`** — wires the two together; fully synchronous (no I/O of its own — the
  three snapshots are fetched by the API service layer and handed in already resolved), computes
  `expiresAt` (`conversationCreatedAt` + `MISSING_INFO_TIMEOUT_HOURS`), and is the only place a
  `MissingInfoResult` is constructed and Zod-validated.

## Step 6 — Availability

- **`computeInventoryStatus`** — pure, zero-I/O (`packages/ai/src/step6/availabilityCalculator.ts`).
  Takes catalog status/active flag, fleet unit counts, and an already-computed overlapping-holds
  count; returns `AVAILABLE`/`UNAVAILABLE`/`MAINTENANCE` deterministically. Never returns
  `HELD`/`BOOKED`/`UNKNOWN` — those describe a hold's own lifecycle or a provider failure, decided by
  its callers, not by this function.
- **`rangesOverlapWithBuffer`** — pure instant-arithmetic overlap check with a symmetric buffer on
  both ends (MASTER-PLAN's "calendar check with buffer" — a turnaround window between a return and
  the next pickup). Correct regardless of which offset the inputs were originally expressed in,
  since it only ever compares `Date#getTime()` values.
- **`FleetProvider`** — the seam between pure Step 6 logic and real physical inventory. Concrete
  implementations live in `apps/api`: `DatabaseFleetProvider` (default — counts real `VehicleUnit`
  rows), `ExternalFleetApiProvider` (a real HTTP adapter for a third-party fleet system, via
  `ssrfSafeFetch`), `NotConfiguredFleetProvider`, `ResilientFleetProvider` (timeout/circuit-breaker/
  rate-limit wrapper, same shape as Step 2's `ResilientLocationProvider`), `CachedFleetProvider` (a
  short Redis TTL in front of the external path only).
- **`AvailabilityProvider`** — a non-committal read (`checkAvailability`), sharing
  `evaluateInventoryStatus` (`apps/api/src/services/inventoryStatusEvaluator.ts`) with
  `ReservationLockService.placeHold` so a preview and the authoritative claim can never silently
  compute "available" differently. Not wired into any route in this phase (see `docs/PHASE-12.md`) —
  exists as the seam a future multi-vehicle preview (Step 7, Alternatives) will use.
- **`ReservationLockService`** (`apps/api`) — the one class that actually claims capacity.
  `placeHold`: validates the request itself (never trusts a caller to have already done so),
  replays an existing hold by idempotency key (checked both before and, again, _inside_ the
  advisory lock — closing a race the pre-lock check alone can't catch between two concurrent
  identical requests), then serializes per-`(tenantId, vehicleId)` via `pg_advisory_xact_lock` before
  re-evaluating status and inserting. `releaseHold`/`confirmHold` use `AvailabilityHold.version`
  (optimistic) instead, each in its own transaction with an `AuditEvent`; `confirmHold` also rejects
  a hold whose `expiresAt` has lapsed even if its `status` column still reads `ACTIVE` (lazy
  expiration applied consistently, not just when counting capacity).
- **Housekeeping sweep, never a correctness dependency.** `expireDueHolds` (`packages/db`) flips
  lapsed `ACTIVE` holds to `EXPIRED` on a plain interval in `apps/worker` (not a BullMQ job — this
  task needs no retry/persistence guarantees, just a periodic idempotent bulk `UPDATE`).

## Observability

Structured JSON logs (pino) with request correlation via `AsyncLocalStorage`, `x-request-id`
propagated on every response. OpenTelemetry tracing bootstraps only when
`OTEL_EXPORTER_OTLP_ENDPOINT` is set — otherwise `bootstrapObservability` returns
`NOT_CONFIGURED` and no exporter runs (see Health API below).

## Health / readiness

- `GET /health` — process identity + `observability` status (`CONFIGURED`/`NOT_CONFIGURED`)
- `GET /live` — liveness + uptime
- `GET /ready` — checks Postgres (`SELECT 1`) and Redis (`PING`); 503 if either is down
